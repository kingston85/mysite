                <h2>My Faith Journey</h2>
                <p>My Christian faith forms the foundation of my identity and provides the moral compass that guides both my personal and professional life. As a believer, I view environmental stewardship not merely as a professional obligation but as a sacred responsibility to care for God's creation.</p>
                
                <p>Growing up in Liberia, I witnessed firsthand both the beauty of our natural environment and the challenges that arise when we fail to properly steward these resources. My journey of faith has helped me understand that protecting our environment is both spiritually fulfilling and vital for the wellbeing of communities.</p>
                
                <p>As a father to my son Augustine, I strive to model values of responsibility, care, and respect for God's creation. I believe that intergenerational equity—ensuring that future generations inherit a healthy planet—is both an environmental principle and a Christian value.</p>
                
                <p>On this page, I share reflections on how my faith informs my approach to environmental science, teaching, and public service. These personal thoughts represent my ongoing journey to integrate spiritual values with professional practice.</p>

                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <p class="scripture-text">"The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it."</p>
                    <p class="scripture-reference">Genesis 2:15</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reflection">
                        <p>This passage establishes humanity's original mandate to care for creation. The Hebrew words for "work" and "take care" imply both cultivation and protection. As environmental professionals, we continue this sacred task of responsible stewardship, finding ways to balance human needs with environmental preservation.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <p class="scripture-text">"The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it; for he founded it on the seas and established it on the waters."</p>
                    <p class="scripture-reference">Psalm 24:1-2</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reflection">
                        <p>This psalm reminds us that the earth ultimately belongs to God, not to us. This perspective shapes my approach to environmental management—we are caretakers, not owners. This calls for humility in our interactions with the natural world and recognition that we are accountable for how we treat what has been entrusted to us.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <p class="scripture-text">"The creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God."</p>
                    <p class="scripture-reference">Romans 8:19-21</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reflection">
                        <p>Paul's profound insight connects human redemption with creation's restoration. This passage inspires me to see environmental work as participation in God's redemptive plan for all creation. When we work to restore damaged ecosystems or prevent pollution, we participate in this broader hope for creation's renewal.</p>
